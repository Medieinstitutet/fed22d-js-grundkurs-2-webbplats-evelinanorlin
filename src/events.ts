    longDescription: '<p>Welcome to an afternoon of exploratory self-leadership, in the sign of movement and yoga. </p> In our fast-moving world, we make thousands of decisions every day, the brain spins faster than ever and is often involved in most of the decisions you make. But sometimes you get a gnawing feeling in your stomach that might mean something isnt right. Do you recognize yourself?</p><p>The brain, heart and stomach are connected by complex nervous systems and are constantly working together, but often the heart and stomach are silenced and the brain takes command.</p><p>In this workshop you will have the opportunity to dive deeper into the body to explore your other two "brains", the heart and the stomach. With the help of meditation, free movement exploration, yoga and reflection, you get the chance to refine your ability to listen to the bodys signals, which are always there and want to be heard.</p><p>During our hours together we will meditate, move, relax and reflect. After the session, there will be tea, snacks and the opportunity to socialize, or hang out as we say in Gothenburg.</p>',
